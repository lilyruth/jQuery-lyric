# This is a simple API retrieval project. 

--The objective was to brush up on jQuery for an upcoming assignment (??) since it's been a bit since I have used it.   
--When the select menu is changed to a different option, this app listens for that change. The change sends a 'song choice' variable to different functions: one to change the background, one to retrieve the lyrics from the lyrics.ovh api, one to add a link to a translation (if the song is not in English) and the last to retrieve the video from YouTube.   
--The lyrics are formatted to a two-column layout for larger screens.   
--This is a mobile-friendly project.
